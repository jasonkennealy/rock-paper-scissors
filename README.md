# Art Quiz App

## The Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### Layout

   Game Page - The page the user is met with is a simple lay out. It consists of circles for each players weapon (rock paper scissors) and the score above.


### Features

- The features of the game consist of a pink circle where their own weapon choice will appear, a green circle where the computer's weapon choice will appear.
   Below this are three ciclres where the user can choose either rock, paper or scissors. When the user does this, the computer will make a random choice and the score is kept above in the user/computer's respective score circles.


- About Section - this section explains the idea behind the quiz and the basic rules on how to play. It has a button with a link to navigate to the top of the game. The player's score, if they have already started the game, is not affected.

- Footer - There are links to the typical social media sites and links to the coder's LinkedIn and the site's GitHub Repository page.

### Future Features

- I would like to add a rounds system where the user could do best out of three games before winning a round.
- A Victory/Lose image or sound. To mark when a player loses or wins.

### Typography and Color

- Typography: The font I chose is simple and does not distract from the game.

- Color-scheme - the colors blue and pink and green were chosen. I used pastel shades as I felt they go together well and are very easy on the eye.


### Technology

- GitHub Desktop for commits/deploys
- CSS, HTML, JavaScript
- GoogleFonts
- <https://ui.dev/amiresponsive> - to check site responsiveness

### Testing

- HTML - <https://validator.w3.org/> - no errors found
- CSS - <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/> - no errors found
- JavaScript - <https://jshint.com/> - no errors found

### Test Cases

#### Play Page

##### Game Section

1. The user clicks which weapon they want and it will appear in their circle, the computer will do the same.
2. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. Depnding on both choices, there is a winner, loser or draw each round.
3. If the user wins, they are given a point. If the computer wins, they are given a point. The score is recorded above the green and pink circles. The user can have as many rounds as they like.


### Supported Screens and Browsers

- The site is fully responsive. It presents well on small and medium-sized devices with no horizontal overflow, as well as on large screen devices.

- It is supported on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari.

### Bug Fixes

- After testing the HTML code for the site, I had to fix two minor errors on the image element - I had to include the alt and the src attributes which I tried to change them to devs which gave the desired effect visually, but the game no longer ran as it should. The current code leaves a couple.

### Deployment
